# ADS Project: New York City Taxi Fare Prediction
## Abstract
A variety of simple models has been proposed to do estimation of the fare amount. 
These models can be straightforward but behave bad in the accuracy of the 
estimation, which RMSE varies from $5 to $8. In this project, in order to find the 
most suitable parameters and features of models first, we will do exploratory data 
analysis, like time analysis, spatial analysis and weather analysis. Then we will 
use ARIMA, Neural Network, LightGBM and Random Forest to do the 
estimation and find the top features that affect the fare amount most.
## Method
1.ARIMA
2. Neural Network
3. LightGBM
4. Random Forest
